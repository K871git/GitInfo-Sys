* ISSUE OF THE the mighty (END) â€” guardian of long outputs in VS Code's terminal. You're bumping into a built-in pager called less, which Git uses to help scroll through long results like git log or git diff.

ðŸ’¡ Why Youâ€™re Seeing (END)
When the output is too long for one screen, Git pipes it through less, a terminal program that:
 # Lets you scroll one page at a time.
 # Shows (END) when you're at the bottom.
 # Blocks normal typing unless you give it specific keys.

ðŸ”“ How to Exit the Pager
When stuck at (END):
 # Press q â€” it quits the pager and returns you to your terminal.
 # Use â†‘ or â†“ to scroll line-by-line.
 # Use Space to page down.
 # Use b to page up.
